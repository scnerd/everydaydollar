Inflation is a controversial topic (see my discussion of the Federal Reserve, coming soon), but the reality right now is that the US dollar is inflationary, as are most currencies around the world. That means that a dollar tomorrow isn't worth a dollar today, and that has implications for long-term saving and investing.

## What is inflation?

Remember when McDonald's dollar menu had more options? When Subway ran the "$5 Footlong" campaign? When gas cost less than $2 per gallon? Or have you watched an older movie where candy cost a penny and goods cost a quarter? Why does everything keep getting more expensive?

The US Dollar (USD) is a fiat currency—a government-issued currency not backed by a physical commodity like gold. The government controls its supply, and the dollar derives its value from legal tender laws and acceptance for tax payments. Like any commodity, the dollar follows the laws of supply and demand.

When more dollars enter circulation while the supply of goods and services remains relatively constant, each dollar buys less. This is inflation. Think of it this way: if the government doubled the money supply overnight, prices would eventually double too. The goods haven't changed in value—the dollar has.

The price of a car in US Dollars depends on two factors: the car's value relative to other goods and services, and the dollar's purchasing power. If _either_ the car becomes more valuable (say, it becomes a collectible) _or_ the dollar's purchasing power declines (through inflation), the price in dollars rises.

What causes more US Dollars to enter circulation? Primarily the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and government debt monetization.

## How does inflation affect me?

[The Federal Reserve targets roughly 2% inflation per year](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/5D58E72F066A4DBDA80BBA659C55F774.htm), though [actual inflation typically ranges from 2-4%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi). For this article, I'll use 2% as a baseline, but keep in mind that real-world inflation may be higher.

Every year, cash loses purchasing power equal to the inflation rate. Consider $100,000 in a savings account:
- Today: buys $100,000 worth of goods
- Next year: buys what $98,000 would have bought today
- After 30 years: buys what $50,000 would have bought today

Your account balance still shows $100,000, but prices have doubled. Unless your money earns more than the inflation rate, you're losing real wealth. Money has no intrinsic value—only purchasing power matters.

This reality affects all investments. A bond paying 3% interest only gains 1% in real purchasing power if inflation is 2%. This inflation adjustment significantly widens the gap between asset classes:
- **Stocks**: 8-12% nominal returns become 6-10% real returns
- **Bonds**: 4-6% nominal returns become 2-4% real returns

Before inflation adjustments, stocks yield roughly 2x what bonds yield. After inflation, that ratio approaches 3x.

Traditional "savings accounts" with <1% interest rates actually lose 1-3% of purchasing power annually. If it earns less than inflation, it's not saving—it's losing.

## Inflation for Retirement Planning

The standard retirement planning process:

1. Assess your current income and lifestyle
2. Determine the retirement income needed to support your desired lifestyle
3. Subtract expected non-investment income (pensions, Social Security)
4. Apply [the 4% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp) to calculate required investment balance
5. Calculate monthly/annual savings needed to reach that balance by retirement

Inflation dramatically affects step 2. The income you'll need must be adjusted for expected inflation between now and retirement.

### The Long-Term Impact

Consider someone 30-40 years from retirement. Using the [rule of 72](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp):

- **At 2% inflation**: Money loses half its value every 36 years → need 2x the income
- **At 3% inflation**: Money loses half its value every 24 years → need 4x the income
- **At 4% inflation**: Money loses half its value every 18 years → need 8x the income

These multiples apply regardless of lifestyle changes—they reflect purely the dollar's declining purchasing power over 40 years.

### The Million-Dollar Myth

The "$1,000,000 retirement target" sounds solid. Using the 4% rule, $1M generates $40,000 annually—a livable income in many areas.

But this advice only works for people within 10-20 years of retirement. For someone in their 20s or 30s, that $1M will generate equivalent purchasing power of $20,000/year or less (assuming 2% inflation over 40 years). Survival possible? Perhaps, under ideal conditions (good health, low cost of living, paid-off housing). Comfortable? Questionable.

For younger savers, the realistic target should be **$2,000,000**. It sounds daunting, but in 40 years, millionaire status won't carry today's cachet. The good news: [the power of compound interest](/posts/the-power-of-compound-growth/) makes this achievable when you start young.

### Summary

Inflation plays a larger role in retirement planning as your time horizon lengthens. Always adjust your target income and savings goals for expected inflation. The math matters—getting it wrong by even a few percentage points can mean the difference between security and struggle in retirement.
