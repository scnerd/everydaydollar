You've heard the advice: "Put 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds." Or maybe it was 80/20. Or 70/30. And then someone tells you to "rebalance annually," whatever that means.

This sounds complex. It's not. Here's the simple version.

## What is Asset Allocation?

Asset allocation is just a fancy term for deciding what percentage of your money goes where. If you have $10,000 to invest and you put $6,000 in stocks and $4,000 in bonds, you have a 60/40 allocation.

That's it. That's the whole concept.

The hard part isn't understanding what allocation means. The hard part is deciding what YOUR allocation should be, and then maintaining it over time.

## Why Does Allocation Matter?

Before we dive into the "how," let's talk about the "why."

Your asset allocation is the single most important investment decision you'll make. More important than which specific funds you choose. More important than whether you pick Vanguard or Fidelity. More important than timing when you invest.

Why? Because your allocation determines two critical things:

1. **How much your portfolio will grow** (your expected returns)
2. **How much it will bounce around** (your volatility)

[Stocks](/posts/what-are-stocks-and-bonds/) historically return around 10% annually but swing wildly year to year (sometimes up 30%, sometimes down 30%). [Bonds](/posts/what-are-stocks-and-bonds/) historically return around 5% annually but are much more stable.

If you're 100% stocks, you get maximum growth but maximum volatility. If you're 100% bonds, you get maximum stability but minimum growth. Somewhere in between is where most people should be.

## Common Allocations (And What They Mean)

Here are the most common allocation strategies you'll hear about:

### 100% Stocks (Aggressive)
- **Best for:** Young investors (20s-30s) with decades until retirement
- **Historical return:** ~10% annually
- **Volatility:** High (can drop 30-50% in bad years)
- **Philosophy:** "I have time to ride out crashes. I want maximum growth."

### 80/20 Stocks/Bonds (Moderately Aggressive)
- **Best for:** Investors in their 30s-40s
- **Historical return:** ~9.5% annually
- **Volatility:** Moderate-high
- **Philosophy:** "I want growth but with a small cushion against crashes."

### 70/30 Stocks/Bonds (Moderate)
- **Best for:** Investors in their 40s-50s
- **Historical return:** ~9% annually
- **Volatility:** Moderate
- **Philosophy:** "I'm balancing growth with stability as I get closer to retirement."

### 60/40 Stocks/Bonds (Moderately Conservative)
- **Best for:** Investors approaching retirement (55-65)
- **Historical return:** ~8.5% annually
- **Volatility:** Moderate-low
- **Philosophy:** "I need my money soon. I can't afford a 50% crash right before retirement."

### 40/60 or 20/80 Stocks/Bonds (Conservative)
- **Best for:** Retirees actively drawing income
- **Historical return:** ~6-7% annually
- **Volatility:** Low
- **Philosophy:** "I'm living off this money. Stability matters more than growth."

Notice something? [As Vanguard's comparison shows](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/model-portfolio-allocation), the difference in returns between these allocations isn't huge. The 70/30 portfolio historically returned 9.4%, while 100% stocks returned 10.2%. That's less than 1% difference.

The real difference is volatility. The 70/30 portfolio drops less during crashes, making it easier to stick with when markets tank.

## How to Choose YOUR Allocation

Forget the risk tolerance questionnaire. You know, the one that asks if you'd panic if your portfolio dropped 20%. Everyone thinks they're brave until it actually happens.

Here's a simpler framework.

### Rule #1: The Age Rule (Starting Point)

A common rule of thumb: **Your stock percentage = 110 - your age**

- Age 25: 85% stocks, 15% bonds
- Age 35: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Age 45: 65% stocks, 35% bonds
- Age 55: 55% stocks, 45% bonds
- Age 65: 45% stocks, 55% bonds

This is a starting point, not a commandment. Some people use "120 - age" if they're more aggressive, or "100 - age" if they're more conservative.

### Rule #2: The Timeline Rule (Overrides Age)

When do you need this money?

- **More than 20 years away:** You can handle high volatility. Go heavy on stocks (80-100%).
- **10-20 years away:** Balance growth and stability (60-80% stocks).
- **5-10 years away:** Shift toward stability (40-60% stocks).
- **Less than 5 years away:** Protect what you have (20-40% stocks).

I'm 30, but if I were saving for a house down payment I needed in 3 years, I'd use a conservative allocation for that money. Age doesn't matter—timeline does.

### Rule #3: The Sleep Test (Final Check)

Imagine the stock market drops 40% tomorrow. Your $100,000 portfolio is now worth $60,000.

If you'd panic and sell everything, you're too aggressive. Dial back your stock allocation until you can honestly say, "I'd leave it alone and keep investing."

That's your real risk tolerance. Not what you think you'd do, but what you'd actually do when you see your account balance plummet.

## What About International Stocks?

Good question. So far I've talked about stocks and bonds, but [the 3-fund portfolio](/posts/the-3-fund-portfolio/) adds a third category: international stocks.

Here's how to think about it:

- **U.S. stocks:** The core of your stock allocation (60-70% of your stock holdings)
- **International stocks:** Diversification (30-40% of your stock holdings)
- **Bonds:** Stability (based on your total allocation)

Example: If you're 35 and following the "110 - age" rule, you'd have 75% stocks and 25% bonds. Within that 75% stock allocation:
- ~50% U.S. stocks
- ~25% international stocks
- 25% bonds

Or simpler: Don't overthink it. A 50/30/20 split (U.S. stocks / international stocks / bonds) works for many people.

## Why Rebalance?

Alright, you've chosen your allocation. You've invested your money. Now what?

Here's the problem: Your allocation won't stay put.

Let's say you start with $10,000 split 60/40:
- $6,000 in stocks
- $4,000 in bonds

One year later, stocks have a great year (+30%) and bonds stay flat:
- Stocks: $6,000 × 1.30 = $7,800
- Bonds: $4,000 × 1.00 = $4,000
- Total: $11,800

Your allocation is now 66% stocks ($7,800 / $11,800) and 34% bonds. You've drifted from 60/40 to 66/34 without doing anything.

If you leave it alone, after a few good years in stocks, you might end up 80/20 or 90/10. You're accidentally more aggressive than you intended.

Rebalancing is the process of bringing your portfolio back to your target allocation.

## How to Rebalance

There are two ways to rebalance:

### Method 1: Sell High, Buy Low (For Existing Portfolios)

Using our example above, to get back to 60/40 on an $11,800 portfolio:
- Target stocks: $11,800 × 0.60 = $7,080
- Target bonds: $11,800 × 0.40 = $4,720

You'd sell $720 of stocks and buy $720 of bonds.

This is the psychological trick that makes rebalancing powerful: **It forces you to sell winners and buy losers.** When stocks are doing great, you trim them. When they're doing poorly, you buy more. It's automatic "buy low, sell high" discipline.

### Method 2: Direct New Contributions (Easier, Often Better)

If you're regularly investing new money, you can rebalance by directing new contributions to whichever asset is underweight.

In our example, your stocks are overweight (66% vs. target 60%). So for your next several contributions, put 100% into bonds until you're back to 60/40.

This method avoids selling anything, which can save on taxes in taxable accounts.

## How Often Should You Rebalance?

**Once a year is plenty.** Pick a date (your birthday, January 1st, tax day) and check your allocation then.

Some people rebalance only when their allocation drifts more than 5% from target. So if you're targeting 60/40, you'd rebalance when you hit 65/35 or 55/45, but not before.

**Don't rebalance more than once a year.** You'll drive yourself crazy and rack up unnecessary transactions.

## Rebalancing Example With Real Numbers

Let's walk through a complete example.

**Starting position (Age 35, using 110 - 35 = 75% stocks):**
- $15,000 in U.S. stocks (50% of total)
- $7,500 in international stocks (25% of total)
- $7,500 in bonds (25% of total)
- Total: $30,000

**One year later:**
- U.S. stocks: $15,000 × 1.25 = $18,750 (great year!)
- International stocks: $7,500 × 1.10 = $8,250 (decent year)
- Bonds: $7,500 × 1.03 = $7,725 (steady)
- Total: $34,725

**Current allocation:**
- U.S. stocks: $18,750 / $34,725 = 54%
- International stocks: $8,250 / $34,725 = 24%
- Bonds: $7,725 / $34,725 = 22%

You've drifted from 50/25/25 to 54/24/22. Is this enough to rebalance? Depends on your rules. It's a 4% drift, so if you use the "5% rule," you'd leave it alone. If you rebalance annually regardless, here's what you'd do:

**Target allocation (50/25/25 on $34,725):**
- U.S. stocks: $34,725 × 0.50 = $17,363
- International stocks: $34,725 × 0.25 = $8,681
- Bonds: $34,725 × 0.25 = $8,681

**Rebalancing transactions:**
- Sell $1,387 of U.S. stocks
- Buy $431 of international stocks
- Buy $956 of bonds

Done. You're back to your target.

## Tax Considerations for Rebalancing

Here's where things get slightly complicated.

### In Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401k, IRA, Roth)
Rebalance freely. Selling and buying within these accounts doesn't trigger taxes. Do it as often as you want.

### In Taxable Accounts (Regular Brokerage)
Every time you sell at a profit, you owe capital gains taxes:
- **Short-term gains** (held less than 1 year): taxed as ordinary income (potentially 20-37%)
- **Long-term gains** (held more than 1 year): taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income

**Strategy for taxable accounts:**
1. Rebalance primarily by directing new contributions to underweight assets
2. Only sell if your allocation has drifted significantly (10%+)
3. If you must sell, sell assets with the smallest gains to minimize taxes
4. Consider tax-loss harvesting: sell losing positions to offset gains

Many investors keep most stocks in taxable accounts (tax-efficient) and most bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (tax-inefficient). But don't let tax considerations prevent you from maintaining your target allocation. Getting your allocation wrong is worse than paying some taxes.

## Dollar-Cost Averaging and Rebalancing

If you're investing regularly (like $500/month from your paycheck), you're already doing something called dollar-cost averaging: buying more shares when prices are low, fewer when prices are high.

Combine this with rebalancing and you've built a powerful system:

1. Each month, invest your $500
2. Direct it to whichever asset is furthest below target
3. Once a year, check if you need to sell/buy to get back to target

This means you're constantly buying more of whatever is underperforming, which is exactly what you want to do.

## The Simple Path

If all of this still sounds complicated, here's the simplest approach:

1. **Choose a target allocation** based on your age or timeline (e.g., 70/30 stocks/bonds)
2. **Pick a date to review** (your birthday, January 1st, whatever)
3. **Once a year, check your allocation**
4. **If you've drifted more than 5%, rebalance** by selling winners and buying losers (or directing new contributions to losers)
5. **Otherwise, leave it alone**

That's it. Don't check your portfolio more often. Don't panic when stocks drop. Don't chase returns when something's doing well.

[Remember: The power of compound growth](/posts/the-power-of-compound-growth/) happens when you leave your money alone and let it grow for decades. Rebalancing once a year keeps your portfolio aligned with your goals without interfering with that growth.

## When to Change Your Allocation

Your allocation isn't set in stone forever. You should adjust it as your life changes:

- **Every 5-10 years:** Re-evaluate as you age
- **Major life changes:** Marriage, kids, job loss, windfall
- **Approaching retirement:** Gradually shift toward bonds (glide path)

But don't change your allocation because of market conditions. Don't go 100% bonds because you think stocks are about to crash. Don't go 100% stocks because you think they're about to soar. You can't time the market. Nobody can.

Change your allocation based on YOUR timeline and YOUR risk tolerance, not on market predictions.

## Final Thoughts

Asset allocation and rebalancing sound technical, but they're really about two things:

1. **Planning:** Deciding how much risk you can handle based on when you need your money
2. **Discipline:** Sticking to that plan even when markets tempt you to abandon it

The 60/40 portfolio isn't magic. Neither is 80/20 or 70/30. What matters is choosing an allocation you can stick with through market ups and downs, then rebalancing to maintain it.

Most people spend hours researching which specific funds to buy and zero time thinking about their allocation. That's backwards. Your allocation determines 90% of your returns. The specific funds you choose? Maybe 10%.

Pick an allocation. Rebalance once a year. [Leave it the f*** alone](/posts/retirement-investing/) the rest of the time.

You can do this.
