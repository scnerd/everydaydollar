## Detailed Reviews

### I. Introductory

**Text:** "This handbook summarizes the essentials of plain English style. It focuses on the rules of usage and principles of composition most often broken, offering a compact alternative to exhaustive manuals. Master the guidance here, then look to the best authors for finer points of style."

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 9/10 — Perfectly exemplifies the principles taught in the handbook
- Clarity: 9/10 — Purpose and scope are immediately transparent
- Brevity: 9/10 — Three sentences convey everything needed
- Usefulness: 8/10 — Sets expectations but lacks actionable specifics

**Comments:** This introduction is a masterclass in efficient exposition. It immediately establishes what the handbook covers, why it matters, and how to use it. The only minor weakness is that it's somewhat abstract—readers don't yet know what "rules of usage" or "principles of composition" mean.

### Rule 1: Form the Possessive Singular of Nouns by Adding 's

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 7/10 — Clear but slightly formal; appropriate tone
- Clarity: 8/10 — The rule is unambiguous, exceptions are well-explained
- Brevity: 7/10 — Contains some repetitive explanation (e.g., mentioning Oxford and Government Printing Office)
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Practical and directly applicable

**Comments:** Authoritative rule with good examples. However, the explanation could be more concise. The exceptions section is thorough but somewhat lengthy for what could be handled with a simple bullet list.

---

### Rule 2: In a Series of Three or More Terms, Use a Comma After Each

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 7/10 — Functional but pedestrian
- Clarity: 8/10 — Examples are clear and helpful
- Brevity: 7/10 — Good; the business firm exception adds useful complexity
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Solves a common punctuation question

**Comments:** Straightforward rule with solid examples. The introduction of the "Oxford comma" (serial comma) is important, and the business firm exception is helpful for real-world applications.

---

### Rule 3: Enclose Parenthetic Expressions Between Commas

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Lucid and well-reasoned
- Clarity: 8/10 — Excellent explanation of restrictive vs. non-restrictive clauses
- Brevity: 6/10 — Substantial length; could be condensed
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Teaches a nuanced principle that resolves common errors

**Comments:** This is the most intellectually sophisticated rule in the usage section. The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses is explained with clarity and careful examples. However, the section is quite long, and some readers might struggle with the abstraction. The examples from Coleridge and Bridgewater help ground the principle.

---

### Rule 4: Place a Comma Before a Conjunction Introducing a Coordinate Clause

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 7/10 — Dense and somewhat technical
- Clarity: 7/10 — Good examples but complex logic
- Brevity: 5/10 — Lengthy for a single principle; many exceptions and subcases
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Critical rule for complex sentence construction

**Comments:** This rule is comprehensive but demanding to follow. The explanation of loose vs. periodic sentences is valuable, but the section feels packed. The revision table helps, but a reader would need to reference this rule multiple times before internalizing it.

---

### Rule 5: Do Not Join Independent Clauses by a Comma

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Clear and direct; excellent pedagogical structure
- Clarity: 8/10 — The comparison of three forms (semicolon, period, comma+conjunction) is illuminating
- Brevity: 7/10 — Efficient, though exceptions add length
- Usefulness: 10/10 — Addresses one of the most common punctuation errors

**Comments:** Excellent teaching. Strunk demonstrates the superiority of the semicolon by showing the same two statements in three forms. The brief exceptions section is appropriately handled. This rule would prevent countless comma splices if widely followed.

---

### Rule 6: Do Not Break Sentences in Two

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Direct and memorable
- Clarity: 9/10 — The main principle is stated in one sentence; examples are perfectly clear
- Brevity: 9/10 — Concise but complete
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Practical and actionable

**Comments:** This is one of the most useful and quotable rules in the handbook. "Do not use periods for commas" is memorable and immediately applicable. The exception about emphatic words is reasonable and well-explained.

---

### Rule 7: A Participial Phrase at the Beginning Must Refer to the Grammatical Subject

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Clear, with good rhythm
- Clarity: 8/10 — The principle is understandable; the revision table is helpful
- Brevity: 8/10 — Well-proportioned
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Prevents common and often ludicrous errors

**Comments:** The note that sentences violating this rule "are often ludicrous" is delightful, and the examples ("Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap") are memorable precisely because they're absurd. The table of common mistakes is very practical.

---

### Rule 8: Make the Paragraph the Unit of Composition

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Logical progression, though somewhat academic
- Clarity: 8/10 — Frameworks for essays and reports are helpful
- Brevity: 6/10 — Lengthy with many examples; the section extends to 40+ lines
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Provides structural guidance for longer compositions

**Comments:** This shifts from punctuation to composition. The examples of paragraph structures (e.g., for analyzing a poem with seven paragraphs) are valuable for students but may be overly prescriptive for experienced writers. The principle is sound; the execution is thorough but verbose.

---

### Rule 9: Begin Each Paragraph with a Topic Sentence

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Well-reasoned and eloquent in places
- Clarity: 8/10 — Principle is clear; examples illustrate well
- Brevity: 5/10 — Very long; includes extended examples from Stevenson and Lecky
- Usefulness: 10/10 — One of the most practical principles in the handbook

**Comments:** The extended examples from Stevenson's "Walking Tours" are excellent—they show how a professional writer implements the principle. The analysis of each sentence's function is instructive. However, the section is quite lengthy, and modern writers might resist the rigidity of always beginning with a topic sentence.

---

### Rule 10: Use the Active Voice

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 9/10 — Engaging and persuasive; exemplifies vigor
- Clarity: 9/10 — Examples clearly demonstrate the advantage of active voice
- Brevity: 8/10 — Concise while being thorough
- Usefulness: 10/10 — Applies to all writing

**Comments:** This is one of the strongest rules in the handbook. The comparison between passive and active constructions is immediate and convincing. The point that "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered" becomes indefinite without "by me" is particularly acute. Strunk also reasonably acknowledges that passive voice has legitimate uses.

---

### Rule 11: Put Statements in Positive Form

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Direct and emphatic
- Clarity: 9/10 — Principle is clear; table of revisions is excellent
- Brevity: 8/10 — Efficient and well-organized
- Usefulness: 10/10 — Applies broadly and corrects common weakness

**Comments:** Strong rule with a convincing table showing "not honest" → "dishonest," etc. The observation that "the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is" is insightful. The examples of antithesis (e.g., "Not charity, but simple justice") show that negation can still be powerful when used intentionally.

---

### Rule 12: Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 9/10 — Eloquent and persuasive; invokes great authors
- Clarity: 9/10 — Principle and examples are crystal clear
- Brevity: 7/10 — Substantial length, but the examples justify it
- Usefulness: 10/10 — One of the most important principles for vivid writing

**Comments:** This rule is elevated by references to Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Browning. The quotation from Browning's "My Last Duchess" is perfect—it demonstrates how specific details create power. The quote from Herbert Spencer on the economy of specific terms is valuable. This section effectively argues why abstraction weakens writing.

---

### Rule 13: Omit Needless Words

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 9/10 — The opening sentence is a gem of conciseness
- Clarity: 9/10 — Principle is immediately understood
- Brevity: 8/10 — Well-organized with multiple tables; could be slightly shorter
- Usefulness: 10/10 — Applicable to all writing

**Comments:** The opening metaphor—"a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts"—is perfect. The tables of redundant expressions are practical and valuable. The note about "the fact that" is particularly helpful, as this phrase is chronically overused.

---

### Rule 14: Avoid a Succession of Loose Sentences

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Clear critique; good structural discussion
- Clarity: 8/10 — The monotonous paragraph example is effective
- Brevity: 7/10 — Reasonably concise
- Usefulness: 8/10 — Valuable principle, though less universally applicable than earlier rules

**Comments:** The paragraph from a concert review is perfect—it demonstrates exactly the kind of mechanical monotony that weakens prose. However, the rule is more applicable to narrative and reportage than to technical or expository writing. The suggestion to replace loose sentences with simple sentences, periodic sentences, or sentences with semicolons is helpful but could use more detailed examples.

---

### Rule 15: Express Coordinate Ideas in Similar Form

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Clear and well-structured
- Clarity: 8/10 — Tables of examples are very helpful
- Brevity: 7/10 — Good length; not overly long
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Prevents awkward and unclear constructions

**Comments:** The opening reference to the Ten Commandments and Lord's Prayer is an elegant touchstone. The principle of parallel construction is explained thoroughly with practical examples. The distinction between "both Henry and I" (correct) and "both a long ceremony and very tedious" (incorrect) is instructive.

---

### Rule 16: Keep Related Words Together

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Logical and persuasive
- Clarity: 8/10 — Tables of examples are clear
- Brevity: 7/10 — Moderate length; reasonable coverage
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Prevents ambiguity and improves readability

**Comments:** This rule addresses word order's role in clarity. The distinction between the subject and main verb being separated is well-explained. The cautionary example about Benjamin Harrison ("This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison... who became President in 1889") effectively demonstrates how poor word placement creates ambiguity.

---

### Rule 17: In Summaries, Keep to One Tense

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Technical but clear
- Clarity: 8/10 — Examples clarify the principle well
- Brevity: 8/10 — Concise and well-organized
- Usefulness: 8/10 — Useful but more specialized than earlier rules

**Comments:** This rule is less universally applicable than others but important for academic writing and textbooks. The examples from Romeo and Juliet are helpful. However, modern writing might be less rigid about tense consistency in summaries.

---

### Rule 18: Place the Emphatic Words of a Sentence at the End

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Elegant discussions of periodic sentences
- Clarity: 8/10 — Examples make the principle clear
- Brevity: 7/10 — Moderate length
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Applies to rhetorical and important writing

**Comments:** The periodic sentence examples from Christopher Columbus and the war exhortation are eloquent. The principle is sound: the end of a sentence naturally carries emphasis. The note about the beginning of a sentence also being emphatic is a useful addition. However, modern prose often prioritizes clarity over rhetorical emphasis.

---

### V. Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

**Ratings:**
- Writing Style: 8/10 — Authoritative and instructive
- Clarity: 8/10 — Clear definitions and examples
- Brevity: 6/10 — Very lengthy; 350+ lines of recommendations
- Usefulness: 9/10 — Acts as a comprehensive reference

**Comments:** This section is a valuable resource but overwhelming in length. Entries range from half a line (for "Bid") to extensive discussion (for "Case," "Factor," "Feature"). The writing is clear and helpful, with practical tables showing incorrect vs. correct usage. Some entries feel dated (1918), but most principles remain relevant. Useful as a reference but challenging to read straight through.

---
