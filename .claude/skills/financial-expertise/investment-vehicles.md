## Stocks

### What They Are
- Shares of ownership in a company
- Buy a stock = become part-owner of that company
- Value determined by market perception and company performance
- Can vote on company decisions (usually negligible for small investors)

### Returns
- **Historical average**: ~10% annually (S&P 500 long-term)
- **Actual experience**: Highly variable year-to-year
  - Can gain 40% one year, lose 30% the next
  - Volatility smooths out over 15-20+ years

### Types

**Individual Stocks:**
- Ownership in single company
- High risk - company-specific problems can wipe out value
- Requires research, monitoring, discipline
- **Not recommended** - see "What to Avoid"

**Stock Mutual Funds:**
- Pool of money buying many stocks
- Professional management (active) or index-tracking (passive)
- Instant diversification

**Stock Index Funds:**
- Tracks entire market index (S&P 500, Total Market, etc.)
- Own thousands of companies automatically
- **Recommended approach**

---

## Bonds

### What They Are
- Loans to governments or corporations
- You're the lender, they're the borrower
- They pay you interest (coupon rate)
- Promise to return principal at maturity

### Returns
- **Historical average**: ~5% annually
- More stable than stocks
- Lower volatility = lower risk = lower returns

### Types

**Government Bonds:**
- U.S. Treasury bonds (safest in world)
- Backed by full faith and credit of U.S. government
- Essentially zero default risk

**Corporate Bonds:**
- Companies borrowing money
- Higher risk than government bonds
- Higher interest rates to compensate for risk
- Quality ranges from AAA (safest) to junk bonds (risky)

**Municipal Bonds:**
- State and local governments
- Often tax-free interest
- Quality varies by municipality

**Bond Funds:**
- Pool of many bonds
- Diversification across issuers and maturities
- **Recommended approach** rather than individual bonds

### Why Hold Bonds?

**Reduces Volatility:**
- Bonds more stable than stocks
- Often gain when stocks fall (not always)
- Smooths portfolio returns

**Income Generation:**
- Regular interest payments
- More predictable than stock dividends

**Capital Preservation:**
- Less likely to lose value than stocks
- Important near/in retirement

**The Trade-Off:**
- Lower risk = Lower returns
- 100% bonds = Safe but probably won't outpace inflation significantly
- Need stocks for long-term growth

---

## Mutual Funds

### What They Are
- Pool of money from many investors
- Managed by fund company (Vanguard, Fidelity, etc.)
- Can hold stocks, bonds, or both
- Trades once per day at closing price

### Types

**Actively Managed:**
- Fund manager picks stocks/bonds
- Tries to beat market benchmark
- Higher fees (average 0.65% expense ratio)
- **Problem**: 89.5% fail to beat index over 15 years

**Index Funds (Passive):**
- Tracks market index (S&P 500, Total Market, etc.)
- No stock picking, just match the index
- Very low fees (average 0.05%)
- **Recommended approach**

### Advantages
- Instant diversification
- Professional administration
- Easy to buy/sell
- Accessible to small investors

### Expense Ratio
- Annual fee charged by fund
- Expressed as percentage
- 0.05% = $5 per $10,000 invested annually
- **Crucial factor** - compounds over decades

---

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

### What They Are
- Similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks
- Usually track an index (passive management)
- Trade throughout the day at market prices
- Very low fees

### Mutual Fund vs. ETF

| Feature | Mutual Fund | ETF |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Trades** | Once daily | Throughout day |
| **Price** | End-of-day NAV | Real-time market price |
| **Minimums** | Often $3,000-$10,000 | One share (maybe $100) |
| **Tax efficiency** | Good | Slightly better |
| **Best for** | Regular investing, IRAs | Taxable accounts, trading |

**For most investors**: The difference doesn't matter much. Choose based on which your broker offers with low/no fees.

### Popular ETFs (2025)

**U.S. Stocks:**
- **VTI** - Vanguard Total Stock Market (0.03% ER)
- **VOO** - Vanguard S&P 500 (0.03% ER)

**International Stocks:**
- **VXUS** - Vanguard Total International Stock (0.07% ER)
- **VEA** - Vanguard Developed Markets (0.05% ER)

**Bonds:**
- **BND** - Vanguard Total Bond Market (0.03% ER)

---

## Index Funds: The Core Recommendation

### What They Are
- Mutual fund or ETF that tracks a market index
- **Index**: List of companies representing a market
  - S&P 500: 500 largest U.S. companies
  - Total Market: All U.S. public companies (~3,500)
  - International: All non-U.S. public companies

### Why Index Funds Win

**Lower Costs:**
- Average index fund: 0.05% expense ratio
- Average active fund: 0.65% expense ratio
- Vanguard index average: 0.05%
- **On $100,000**: $50/year vs $650/year

**Better Performance:**
- Only 10.5% of active funds beat S&P 500 over 15 years
- 89.5% of professionals with research teams can't beat the index
- Individual investors do even worse (4-5% annual underperformance)

**Tax Efficiency:**
- Low turnover (only trades when index changes)
- Fewer taxable capital gains distributions
- Especially important in taxable accounts

**Simplicity:**
- No stock picking decisions
- No market timing
- No manager risk (what if manager leaves?)
- Just own the entire market

**Diversification:**
- Total Stock Market fund = ~3,500 companies
- One fund = instant diversification
- Captures all winners automatically

### The Data

**Dalbar QAIB 2024 Report:**
- Average equity fund investor earned 8.5% less than S&P 500
- Gap caused by poor timing decisions (buy high, sell low)

**SPIVA Scorecard:**
- 89.5% of active U.S. large-cap funds underperformed S&P 500 (15 years)
- 95% of active international funds underperformed (15 years)

**Why Professionals Fail:**
- Higher fees eat returns
- Trading costs
- Can't predict market movements
- Behavioral mistakes
- Nobody knows which stocks will be tomorrow's winners

## The 3-Fund Portfolio (Bogleheads)

### The Concept
Complete global diversification with just three total market index funds.

### The Three Funds

1. **U.S. Total Stock Market**
   - All U.S. companies (~3,500)
   - Vanguard: VTSAX (mutual fund) or VTI (ETF)
   - Fidelity: FSKAX
   - Schwab: SWTSX

2. **Total International Stock Market**
   - All non-U.S. companies
   - Vanguard: VTIAX (mutual fund) or VXUS (ETF)
   - Fidelity: FTIHX
   - Schwab: SWISX

3. **U.S. Total Bond Market**
   - All U.S. investment-grade bonds
   - Vanguard: VBTLX (mutual fund) or BND (ETF)
   - Fidelity: FXNAX
   - Schwab: SWAGX

### Example Allocations

**Young/Aggressive (Age 20-30):**
- 54% U.S. Stocks
- 36% International Stocks
- 10% Bonds

**Moderate (Age 40):**
- 42% U.S. Stocks
- 18% International Stocks
- 40% Bonds

**Conservative (Age 60):**
- 28% U.S. Stocks
- 12% International Stocks
- 60% Bonds

**Alternative Simple Split:**
- 50% U.S. Stocks
- 30% International Stocks
- 20% Bonds
- Adjust bond percentage by age (110 - age = stock %)

### Why This Works

**Complete Diversification:**
- Own essentially every public company in the world
- U.S. + International = global market exposure
- Bonds for stability

**Simple to Maintain:**
- Three funds to buy
- Rebalance once a year
- No complicated decisions

**Low Cost:**
- Vanguard three-fund ER: ~0.05% average
- Active alternative: 0.65%+
- Difference compounds to tens of thousands over lifetime

**Evidence-Based:**
- Based on decades of research
- Proven by Bogleheads community
- Endorsed by Nobel Prize-winning economists

### Rebalancing

**When:**
- Annually on set date (Jan 1, birthday, etc.)
- OR when allocation drifts 5%+ from target

**How:**
1. Check current percentages
2. Sell overweight assets
3. Buy underweight assets
4. OR direct new contributions to underweight assets

**Example:**
- Target: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Actual: 70% stocks, 30% bonds (stocks had good year)
- Rebalance: Sell 10% stocks, buy bonds with proceeds
- Result: Forces "buy low, sell high" discipline

## The 1-Fund Portfolio

### Even Simpler Than 3-Fund

One fund that handles everything automatically.

### Option 1: Target Date Fund

**What It Is:**
- Single fund named by approximate retirement year
- Example: "Target Retirement 2050" for someone retiring ~2050
- Automatically adjusts allocation over time
- Starts aggressive (heavy stocks), gradually shifts conservative (more bonds)

**How It Works:**
- Young: 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- Middle age: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Near retirement: 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- In retirement: 30% stocks, 70% bonds
- Handles all rebalancing automatically

**Examples:**
- Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (VFIFX)
- Fidelity Freedom 2050 (FFFHX)
- Schwab Target 2050 (SWYMX)

**Advantages:**
- Ultimate simplicity - one fund for life
- Automatic rebalancing
- Appropriate risk adjustment over time
- No decision paralysis

**Disadvantages:**
- Slightly higher fees (0.08-0.15% vs 0.05% for 3-fund)
- Less control over specific allocation
- "Glide path" may not match your preferences

**When to Use:**
- Want maximum simplicity
- Don't want to think about investing
- Paralyzed by choices
- Happy to outsource allocation decisions

### Option 2: Life Strategy Fund

**What It Is:**
- Single fund with fixed stock/bond ratio
- Choose aggressiveness level once
- Vanguard LifeStrategy funds

**Options:**
- **LifeStrategy Growth (VASGX)**: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- **LifeStrategy Moderate Growth (VSMGX)**: 60/40 split
- **LifeStrategy Conservative Growth (VSCGX)**: 40/60 split
- **LifeStrategy Income (VASIX)**: 20/80 split

**Advantages:**
- Simple - one fund
- You control stock/bond ratio
- Automatic rebalancing
- Low fees (~0.13%)

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't auto-adjust with age (you must change funds manually)
- Less popular than target date funds

**When to Use:**
- Want one-fund simplicity
- Prefer fixed allocation over automatic glide path
- Available in your 401(k) but target date isn't

### Option 3: Total Market Fund + Manual Bond Allocation

**What It Is:**
- Hold total stock market fund for stocks
- Add bond fund at your desired percentage
- Essentially 2-fund portfolio (U.S. + Bonds only)

**Example:**
- Age 30, want 80/20 split
- 80% Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTSAX)
- 20% Vanguard Total Bond Market (VBTLX)

**Advantages:**
- Simpler than 3-fund (no international)
- Full control
- Lowest possible fees

**Disadvantages:**
- No international diversification
- Must rebalance manually

**When to Use:**
- Want simplicity but some control
- Don't care about international stocks
- Willing to rebalance annually

## Dave Ramsey's 4-Fund Recommendation

Ramsey recommends dividing investments equally across four categories:

1. **Growth & Income**: Large-cap value stocks
2. **Growth**: Large-cap growth stocks
3. **Aggressive Growth**: Small/mid-cap stocks
4. **International**: Non-U.S. stocks

**25% to each category**

### Bogleheads vs. Ramsey

**Ramsey Approach:**
- More categories
- All stocks (no bonds until close to retirement)
- More aggressive

**Bogleheads Approach:**
- Simpler (3 funds)
- Includes bonds for stability
- Single total market fund instead of splitting by style

**Reality:**
- Both work fine
- Ramsey's adds complexity without proven benefit
- Bogleheads' total market approach simpler and equally effective
- **Preference**: Bogleheads 3-fund for simplicity and evidence

## Expense Ratios: Why They Matter

### The Math

**Scenario**: $100,000 invested for 30 years at 10% annual return

**With 0.05% ER (Index Fund):**
- End balance: $1,739,858
- Fees paid: $30,858

**With 0.65% ER (Active Fund):**
- End balance: $1,513,046
- Fees paid: $226,954

**Difference: $226,796**

That's $226,796 less just from higher fees!

### Every 0.10% Matters

On $100,000 over 30 years at 10% return:

| Expense Ratio | End Balance | Difference from 0.05% |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0.05% | $1,739,858 | $0 |
| 0.15% | $1,700,465 | -$39,393 |
| 0.25% | $1,662,127 | -$77,731 |
| 0.50% | $1,568,243 | -$171,615 |
| 1.00% | $1,394,457 | -$345,401 |

**Key Insight**: You can't control market returns, but you CAN control fees. Keep them as low as possible.

### Target Expense Ratios

**Excellent**: 0.05% or less
**Good**: 0.05-0.15%
**Acceptable**: 0.15-0.30%
**Avoid**: 0.30%+

**Never accept**: 1%+ (actively managed funds often charge this)

---

## Asset Location: Which Account for Which Investments

### Tax-Advantaged (401k, IRA, Roth)
**Best for:**
- Bonds (generate ordinary income)
- REITs (generate ordinary income)
- Actively managed funds (high turnover)
- Any investment that generates lots of taxable income

**Why:**
- Growth and dividends tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (Traditional)

### Taxable Brokerage
**Best for:**
- Total stock market index funds (tax-efficient)
- Municipal bonds (already tax-free)
- Long-term holdings (qualified capital gains rate)

**Avoid:**
- Bonds (except municipal)
- High-dividend stocks
- High-turnover funds

### Simplification

If this is too complex, just keep it simple:
- Fill up tax-advantaged accounts first with everything
- Only use taxable account after maxing 401k and IRA
- Use same 3-fund portfolio in taxable as tax-advantaged

---

## Key Principle

**Simple beats complex**

A 3-fund portfolio of low-cost index funds will outperform the vast majority of complex portfolios, professional managers, and individual stock pickers over time.

The best portfolio is the one you'll stick with through market ups and downs.
