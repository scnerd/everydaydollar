## Bogleheads Investment Philosophy

Named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard and creator of the first index fund.

### Core Tenets

1. **Simplicity is Key**
   - When multiple solutions exist, choose the simplest
   - Complex strategies rarely outperform simple ones
   - Less to manage = fewer mistakes

2. **Low Costs Matter Enormously**
   - Average index fund: 0.05% expense ratio
   - Average active fund: 0.65% expense ratio
   - Vanguard average: 0.05% vs industry average 0.17%
   - On $100,000: $50/year vs $650/year difference
   - Compounds to massive differences over decades

3. **Broad Diversification**
   - Single total stock market index = thousands of companies
   - Eliminates company-specific risk
   - Captures all market winners automatically
   - Build effective portfolio with 2-3 funds

4. **Passive Over Active Management**
   - **89.5% of active funds fail** to beat S&P 500 over 15 years
   - Higher fees + frequent trading = lower net returns
   - Can't predict which active fund will be in the 10.5%
   - Index funds guarantee market returns minus minimal fees

5. **Long-Term Perspective**
   - Buy and hold for decades
   - Ignore short-term volatility
   - Market timing doesn't work
   - Time in market > timing the market

6. **Proper Asset Allocation**
   - Mix of stocks and bonds based on age/risk tolerance
   - Stocks for growth, bonds for stability
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain target
   - More important than individual security selection

7. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts first (401k, IRA)
   - Roth vs Traditional based on tax situation
   - Consider tax implications of trades
   - Index funds naturally tax-efficient (low turnover)

### Performance Reality

- **Only 10.5%** of actively managed funds outperformed S&P 500 over 15 years
- Average equity fund investor earned **8.5% less** than S&P 500 in 2024 (Dalbar)
- Self-directed investors underperform by **4-5% annually**

## Dave Ramsey's Philosophy

### Core Principle

**"Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior"**

Focus on behavior change and momentum over pure mathematical optimization.

### The 7 Baby Steps

1. **Save $1,000 for starter emergency fund**
   - Fast, achievable first win
   - Basic cushion while attacking debt

2. **Pay off all debt (except house) using debt snowball**
   - Smallest balance first (ignore interest rates)
   - Quick psychological wins maintain motivation
   - Momentum builds as payments snowball

3. **Save 3-6 months of expenses for full emergency fund**
   - True financial security
   - High-yield savings account
   - Before investing beyond employer match

4. **Invest 15% of household income for retirement**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts
   - Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s with match
   - Solid mutual funds (his recommendation: 4 categories)

5. **Save for children's college fund**
   - 529 plans
   - After your retirement is secured

6. **Pay off home early**
   - Freedom from all debt
   - Massive cash flow increase

7. **Build wealth and give generously**
   - Continue investing
   - Give to causes you believe in
   - Help others

### Key Philosophy Points

- **Debt is the enemy**: Get completely out of debt before aggressive investing
- **Behavior over math**: Emotional wins > mathematical optimization
- **Cash is king**: Use cash/debit, avoid credit cards
- **Gazelle intensity**: Attack financial goals with focused intensity
- **Emergency fund first**: Before investing beyond employer match
- **Mutual funds**: Prefers mutual funds over individual stocks
  - Growth & Income
  - Growth
  - Aggressive Growth
  - International
- **Roth preference**: Tax-free growth when available

### Ramsey's Debt Snowball Defense

"Paying off debt is about momentum, not math. Hardly anyone finishes the avalanche, and millions have completed the Debt Snowball."

**Supported by Research**: Harvard Business Review study confirms starting with smallest debt helps maintain motivation.

## YNAB (You Need A Budget) Method

### Philosophy

Zero-based budgeting where every dollar is assigned a specific job. Focus on **proactive planning** rather than tracking past spending.

### The Four Rules

#### 1. Give Every Dollar a Job
- Assign all available money to specific categories
- Budget only money you currently have (not future income)
- Forces intentional decision-making
- No money sits unassigned

#### 2. Embrace Your True Expenses
- Break large, infrequent expenses into monthly amounts
- Examples: car insurance, holiday shopping, annual subscriptions, car repairs
- Eliminates "surprise" expenses
- Makes irregular expenses predictable

#### 3. Roll With the Punches
- Flexibility when reality differs from plan
- Move money between categories as needed
- Adjust budget throughout month without guilt
- Budget is a plan, not a prison

#### 4. Age Your Money
- Goal: Pay this month's bills with last month's income
- Creates 30+ day buffer between earning and spending
- Breaks paycheck-to-paycheck cycle
- Financial breathing room

**Note**: As of May 2025, YNAB introduced "Five Key Questions" approach, but Four Rules remain the foundation.

### Zero-Based Budgeting Principles

- Every dollar of income assigned to category
- Spending + Saving + Giving + Debt Payoff = Income
- Income minus all assignments = zero
- Forces awareness of where money goes
- Prevents unconscious spending
- Proactive rather than reactive

## Unified Philosophy: The Easy Dollar Approach

### What We Believe

1. **Simplicity wins**
   - 3-fund portfolio beats complex strategies
   - Simple debt payoff beats sophisticated leverage
   - Clear plans beat complicated optimization

2. **Evidence matters**
   - Follow what data proves works
   - Avoid what statistics prove fails
   - Don't fall for anecdotes and survivorship bias

3. **Behavior is crucial**
   - Math alone doesn't change lives
   - Quick wins maintain motivation
   - Sustainable habits beat perfect plans

4. **Low costs are non-negotiable**
   - Every 0.10% in fees compounds over decades
   - Index funds with 0.05% vs active funds with 0.65%
   - You can't control returns, but you control costs

5. **Avoid debt**
   - Debt transfers wealth from you to lenders
   - Eliminate consumer debt completely
   - Even "good" debt (mortgage) should be minimized

6. **Emergency funds before investing**
   - Financial security prevents setbacks
   - 3-6 months expenses in HYSA
   - Peace of mind has value beyond returns

7. **Time is your greatest asset**
   - Compound interest requires time
   - Start early, even with small amounts
   - Decades of consistent saving > large late contributions

### What We Oppose

1. **Stock picking** → 89.5% of pros fail, individuals do worse
2. **Day trading** → 80-95% failure rate, gambling not investing
3. **Credit card rewards chasing** → Behavioral spending increases 12-18%
4. **Debt leverage** → Risk amplification, forced selling in downturns
5. **High-fee active funds** → Can't predict winners, fees compound against you
6. **Complex strategies** → More complexity = more ways to fail
7. **Market timing** → Nobody can consistently time the market

### The Simple Path

1. Budget intentionally (YNAB)
2. Build emergency fund ($1,000 then 3-6 months)
3. Eliminate all consumer debt (snowball method)
4. Invest 15%+ in low-cost index funds (401k, IRA)
5. Use appropriate asset allocation for age
6. Stay the course for decades
7. Let compound interest do the heavy lifting

**Key Insight**: Personal finance isn't complex. It's simple, but requires discipline, patience, and consistently following evidence-based principles.
