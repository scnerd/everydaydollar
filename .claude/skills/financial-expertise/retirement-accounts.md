## 2025 Contribution Limits

### Employer-Sponsored Plans

**401(k), 403(b), 457, TSP**
- Standard contribution: **$23,500** per year
- Age 50+ catch-up: Additional **$7,500** (Total: $31,000)
- Age 60-63 super catch-up: Additional **$11,250** (Total: $34,750)
- Total limit with employer contributions: **$70,000**

### Individual Retirement Accounts

**IRA & Roth IRA (Combined Limit)**
- Standard contribution: **$7,000** per year
- Age 50+ catch-up: Additional **$1,000** (Total: $8,000)
- **Important**: $7,000 limit is shared between Traditional and Roth IRAs
  - Can't contribute $7,000 to each
  - Example: $4,000 to Traditional + $3,000 to Roth = $7,000 total

### Key Points

- **Employer plan and IRA limits are independent**
  - Can max out 401(k) AND IRA in same year
  - Example: $23,500 to 401(k) + $7,000 to IRA = $30,500 total

- **Employer match doesn't count toward employee limit**
  - Your $23,500 + Employer $5,000 = $28,500 total
  - But your contribution limit still $23,500

## Traditional vs. Roth

### Traditional (Pre-Tax)

**How It Works:**
- Contribute money before paying income tax
- Reduces current taxable income
- Money grows tax-deferred
- Pay income tax on withdrawals in retirement
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start age 73

**Example:**
- Earn $50,000, contribute $5,000
- Taxable income: $45,000 (saved tax on $5,000)
- At 22% tax bracket: Saved $1,100 in taxes now
- Pay tax on withdrawals later at whatever bracket you're in

**Best For:**
- High income now, expect lower in retirement
- Need current tax deduction
- Expect to be in lower tax bracket later
- Close to retirement (less time for growth to compound)

### Roth (Post-Tax)

**How It Works:**
- Contribute money after paying income tax
- No current tax benefit
- Money grows tax-free
- Withdrawals in retirement completely tax-free
- No Required Minimum Distributions during your lifetime

**Example:**
- Earn $50,000, contribute $5,000
- Taxable income: Still $50,000 (no deduction)
- Pay taxes now at current rate
- Never pay taxes on this money again
- All growth tax-free

**Best For:**
- Young with lower current income
- Expect to be in higher tax bracket in retirement
- Want tax diversification
- Value flexibility (no RMDs, can access contributions anytime)
- Want tax-free inheritance for heirs

### Roth Income Limits (2025)

## Which to Choose: Decision Framework

### Choose Roth If:

✅ Young (20s-30s) with lower current income
✅ Expect income to increase significantly
✅ Expect higher tax rates in future (personal or national)
✅ Want flexibility (no RMDs)
✅ Want to leave tax-free inheritance
✅ Already have Traditional accounts (tax diversification)
✅ Willing to pay taxes now for tax-free growth later

### Choose Traditional If:

✅ High income now (high tax bracket)
✅ Expect lower income in retirement
✅ Need current tax deduction
✅ Close to retirement (less time for tax-free growth to compound)
✅ Expect to move to state with no income tax in retirement
✅ Want to reduce current taxable income

### Best Strategy: Tax Diversification

**Have Both Roth AND Traditional:**
- Provides flexibility in retirement
- Can optimize tax situation year by year
- Withdraw from Traditional in low-income years
- Withdraw from Roth when it would push you into higher bracket
- Or withdraw from Roth for tax-free income anytime

**Example Mix:**
- Traditional 401(k) through employer
- Roth IRA on your own
- Result: Some pre-tax, some post-tax money

## Account Priority Order (Dave Ramsey Approach)

**After Baby Step 3 (Full Emergency Fund):**

1. **401(k) up to employer match**
   - Free money, instant return
   - Always do this first

2. **Roth IRA to maximum**
   - $7,000 per person ($14,000 for married couple)
   - More control, better fund options
   - Tax-free growth

3. **Back to 401(k) to reach 15% total**
   - If match + Roth IRA < 15% of income
   - Continue in 401(k) to hit 15% total

4. **Taxable brokerage account**
   - Only after maxing out tax-advantaged options
   - For additional investing beyond 15%

**15% Target:**
- 15% of gross household income to retirement
- Includes employer match
- Example: $100,000 income → $15,000/year

## Common Account Combinations

### Scenario 1: Employer with Good 401(k)

### Scenario 2: Employer with Bad 401(k) (High Fees)

- Consider rolling to IRA when changing jobs

### Scenario 3: Self-Employed

- Plus profit-sharing as "employer": Up to $70,000 total
- Or SEP-IRA: Up to 25% of compensation
- Or Roth IRA: $7,000

### Scenario 4: Young, Starting Out
- At minimum: 401(k) to get full match

## Special Considerations

1. Leave it (if good low-cost options)
2. Roll to new employer's 401(k)

4. Cash out (NEVER do this - pay taxes + 10% penalty)

**Rollover Process:**
- Direct rollover (funds never touch your hands)
- No taxes or penalties if done correctly
- Traditional 401(k) → Traditional IRA (no tax)
- Roth 401(k) → Roth IRA (no tax)
- Traditional → Roth (taxable conversion)

- Doesn't apply to IRAs

**72(t) / SEPP:**

- Can access IRA/401(k) before 59½ without penalty
- Must continue for 5 years or until 59½, whichever is longer
- Complex rules, consult tax professional

### Mega Backdoor Roth

For high earners with specific 401(k) plans:
- After-tax (not Roth) 401(k) contributions
- Up to $70,000 total limit
- Convert after-tax to Roth
