## Rule of 72

### Quick Doubling Time Calculation

**Formula**: 72 ÷ annual return = years to double

**Examples:**
- 10% return: 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2 years to double
- 8% return: 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years to double
- 6% return: 72 ÷ 6 = 12 years to double
- 5% return: 72 ÷ 5 = 14.4 years to double
- 3% return: 72 ÷ 3 = 24 years to double

### Application to Inflation

**For money LOSING value:**
- 2% inflation: 72 ÷ 2 = 36 years for money to lose half its value
- 3% inflation: 72 ÷ 3 = 24 years for money to lose half its value

### Real-World Example

**Historical Stock Market (~9% average):**
- Money doubles every 8 years
- $10,000 → $20,000 (8 years)
- $10,000 → $40,000 (16 years)
- $10,000 → $80,000 (24 years)
- $10,000 → $160,000 (32 years)

**Without adding a single dollar**, $10,000 becomes $160,000 in 32 years just from compound growth.

### Required Return Calculation

**Reverse the formula**: 72 ÷ desired years = required return

**Examples:**
- Want to double money in 6 years? 72 ÷ 6 = 12% return needed
- Want to double in 10 years? 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2% return needed
- Want to double in 15 years? 72 ÷ 15 = 4.8% return needed

## 4% Withdrawal Rule

### Safe Retirement Withdrawal Rate

**Formula**: Withdraw 4% of portfolio value in first year, adjust for inflation thereafter

**Example:**
- Portfolio: $1,000,000
- Year 1: Withdraw $40,000 (4%)
- Year 2 (3% inflation): Withdraw $41,200
- Year 3 (3% inflation): Withdraw $42,436
- Continue adjusting for inflation

**Success Rate**: 95% chance money lasts 30+ years (based on historical data)

### Alternative Approaches

**More Conservative (3.5% rule):**
- Lower chance of running out
- Good for early retirement (need 40+ years)
- $1,000,000 → $35,000/year

**More Aggressive (5% rule):**
- Higher withdrawal, higher risk
- Might be okay for late retirement (need only 20 years)
- $1,000,000 → $50,000/year

### Practical Use

**How much do you need for retirement?**

**Method 1: Target Withdrawal**
- Want $50,000/year income?
- Need: $50,000 ÷ 0.04 = $1,250,000

**Method 2: 25x Rule**
- Save 25× your annual expenses
- Want $40,000/year? Need 25 × $40,000 = $1,000,000
- Same result as 4% rule (4% = 1/25)

## Emergency Fund Sizing

### How Much to Save

**Standard Rule**: 3-6 months of essential expenses

**Essential Expenses Include:**
- Housing (rent/mortgage)
- Utilities (electric, water, gas, internet)
- Food (groceries, not restaurants)
- Insurance (health, auto, home)
- Minimum debt payments
- Transportation (gas, public transit)

**Essential Expenses DO NOT Include:**
- Entertainment / streaming services
- Dining out
- Hobbies
- Vacations
- Luxury items

### Adjustment by Situation

**3 Months:**
- Dual income household
- Excellent job security
- Strong employer benefits
- Low expenses

**6 Months:**
- Single income household
- Average job security
- Standard situation
- Moderate expenses

**6-12 Months:**
- Self-employed
- Freelancer
- Commission-based income
- Irregular income
- Industry with high volatility

### Calculation Example

**Monthly Essential Expenses:**
- Mortgage/Rent: $1,500
- Utilities: $200
- Food: $400
- Insurance: $300
- Car payment: $250
- Transportation: $150
- **Total: $2,800/month**

**Emergency Fund Targets:**
- 3 months: $2,800 × 3 = $8,400
- 6 months: $2,800 × 6 = $16,800
- 12 months: $2,800 × 12 = $33,600

## Retirement Savings Target

### 15% Rule (Dave Ramsey)

**Formula**: 15% of gross household income

**Example:**
- Household income: $80,000/year
- 15% = $12,000/year = $1,000/month

**Includes:**
- Your 401(k) contributions
- Employer match
- IRA contributions
- Roth IRA contributions

**Doesn't include:**
- Emergency fund savings
- Down payment savings
- Other non-retirement savings

### Monthly Calculation

**Gross Monthly Income × 0.15**

- $3,000/month → $450/month to retirement
- $5,000/month → $750/month to retirement
- $8,000/month → $1,200/month to retirement
- $10,000/month → $1,500/month to retirement

### Priority Order

1. **401(k) up to employer match** (free money)
2. **Roth IRA to maximum** ($7,000/year or $583/month)
3. **Back to 401(k)** to reach 15% total if needed

## Asset Allocation Formulas

### Rule of 110

**Formula**: 110 - your age = % in stocks

**Examples:**
- Age 25: 110 - 25 = 85% stocks, 15% bonds
- Age 35: 110 - 35 = 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Age 45: 110 - 45 = 65% stocks, 35% bonds
- Age 55: 110 - 55 = 55% stocks, 45% bonds
- Age 65: 110 - 65 = 45% stocks, 55% bonds

**Philosophy**: Moderate risk, balances growth and stability

### Rule of 120 (More Aggressive)

**Formula**: 120 - your age = % in stocks

**Examples:**
- Age 25: 120 - 25 = 95% stocks, 5% bonds
- Age 35: 120 - 35 = 85% stocks, 15% bonds
- Age 45: 120 - 45 = 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Age 55: 120 - 55 = 65% stocks, 35% bonds
- Age 65: 120 - 65 = 55% stocks, 45% bonds

**Philosophy**: More aggressive, longer time horizon assumed

### Age as Bond Percentage (Most Aggressive)

**Formula**: Your age = % in bonds

**Examples:**
- Age 25: 5% bonds, 95% stocks (age/20 variation)
- Age 30: 30% bonds, 70% stocks
- Age 40: 40% bonds, 60% stocks
- Age 50: 50% bonds, 50% stocks
- Age 60: 60% bonds, 40% stocks

**Philosophy**: Very aggressive when young, gradually conservative

### Which to Use?

**Rule of 110**: Most common, reasonable for most people
**Rule of 120**: If you're comfortable with more risk
**Age as bond %**: If you're very risk-tolerant when young

**Reality**: Any of these are fine. Being consistent matters more than which formula.

## Compound Interest Calculations

### Future Value Formula

**Formula**: FV = PV × (1 + r)^n

Where:
- FV = Future Value
- PV = Present Value (starting amount)
- r = annual return rate (as decimal)
- n = number of years

**Example:**
- Start with $10,000
- 10% return
- 30 years
- FV = $10,000 × (1.10)^30 = $174,494

### With Regular Contributions

**Formula**: FV = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]

Where:
- PMT = regular payment amount
- r = annual return rate (as decimal)
- n = number of years

**Example:**
- $500/month ($6,000/year)
- 10% return
- 30 years
- FV = $6,000 × [((1.10)^30 - 1) / 0.10] = $986,964

### Combined (Starting Amount + Regular Contributions)

**Example:**
- Start: $10,000
- Add: $500/month ($6,000/year)
- Return: 10%
- Time: 30 years

**Result:**
- Starting amount grows to: $174,494
- Contributions grow to: $986,964
- **Total: $1,161,458**

**Contributed: $10,000 + $180,000 = $190,000**
**Growth: $971,458 (84% from compound interest!)**

## Inflation Adjustment

### Future Purchasing Power

**Formula**: Future Amount = Current Amount × (1 + inflation)^years

**With 3% inflation:**
- $40,000 today in 10 years: $40,000 × 1.34 = $53,600
- $40,000 today in 20 years: $40,000 × 1.81 = $72,400
- $40,000 today in 30 years: $40,000 × 2.43 = $97,200
- $40,000 today in 40 years: $40,000 × 3.26 = $130,400

### Why It Matters

**"I need $1 million for retirement"**

If you're 30 years from retirement:
- $1 million today = $2.43 million needed (3% inflation)
- "Million dollar retirement" is moving target
- Must account for inflation in planning

### Real vs. Nominal Returns

**Nominal return**: What the investment states (e.g., 10%)
**Real return**: After inflation (e.g., 10% - 3% = 7%)

**Why it matters:**
- Nominal $174,494 growth becomes ~$71,800 purchasing power (30 years, 3% inflation)
- Plan for real returns, not nominal

## Net Worth Calculation

### Formula

**Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth**

### Assets Include

- Cash in checking/savings
- Investment accounts (401k, IRA, taxable)
- Home value (realistic market value)
- Car value (be realistic, they depreciate)
- Other property/valuable assets

### Liabilities Include

- Mortgage balance
- Student loans
- Car loans
- Credit card debt
- Personal loans
- Any other debts

### Example

**Assets:**
- Checking/Savings: $15,000
- 401(k): $75,000
- Roth IRA: $25,000
- Home value: $350,000
- Cars: $25,000
- **Total Assets: $490,000**

**Liabilities:**
- Mortgage: $280,000
- Car loans: $15,000
- Student loans: $20,000
- **Total Liabilities: $315,000**

**Net Worth: $490,000 - $315,000 = $175,000**

### Age Benchmarks (Rough Guidelines)

These are ROUGH targets, not rules:

- Age 30: **1× annual salary**
  - Example: $50,000 salary → $50,000 net worth

- Age 40: **3× annual salary**
  - Example: $75,000 salary → $225,000 net worth

- Age 50: **6× annual salary**
  - Example: $90,000 salary → $540,000 net worth

- Age 60: **8× annual salary**
  - Example: $100,000 salary → $800,000 net worth

- Age 67: **10× annual salary**
  - Example: $100,000 salary → $1,000,000 net worth

**Note**: These are guidelines. Being behind doesn't mean failure. Focus on improving YOUR trajectory.

## Employer Match Value

### Calculating Free Money

**Scenario**: Employer matches 50% of first 6% of salary

**Example (Salary: $60,000):**
- You contribute: 6% × $60,000 = $3,600
- Employer adds: 50% × $3,600 = $1,800
- Total invested: $5,400
- Your cost: $3,600
- **Instant 50% return**

**Monthly:**
- You contribute: $3,600 ÷ 12 = $300/month
- Employer adds: $1,800 ÷ 12 = $150/month
- Total: $450/month invested

### Common Match Structures

**50% match on first 6%:**
- Contribute 6%, get 3% match
- Total: 9% of salary invested

**100% match on first 3%:**
- Contribute 3%, get 3% match
- Total: 6% of salary invested

**100% match on first 4% + 50% on next 2%:**
- Contribute 6%, get 5% match
- Total: 11% of salary invested

### Never Leave This on the Table

If employer matches, **ALWAYS contribute enough to get full match**. It's free money with instant return.

## Rebalancing Threshold

### When to Rebalance

**Time-Based**: Annually on set date (Jan 1, birthday, etc.)

**Threshold-Based**: When allocation drifts 5% from target

**Example with 60/40 target (60% stocks, 40% bonds):**

**Current Allocation:**
- Stocks: 70%
- Bonds: 30%

**Drift from target:**
- Stocks: 70% - 60% = 10% over (triggers rebalance)
- Bonds: 30% - 40% = 10% under

**Action**: Sell some stocks, buy bonds to get back to 60/40

### Rebalancing with New Money

**Better approach** (no taxes in taxable accounts):
- Direct new contributions to underweight asset
- Example: Stocks high → Direct new money to bonds
- Gradually brings allocation back to target
- No selling = No tax event

## College Savings (529 Plans)

### How Much Per Child

**Current Costs (estimate):**
- In-state public: $100,000-$150,000
- Out-of-state public: $200,000-$250,000
- Private: $200,000-$300,000

**Account for inflation** (6% for college costs, higher than general inflation)

### Monthly Savings Target

**Need $150,000 in 18 years, assuming 7% return:**
- Save ~$375/month

**Need $100,000 in 18 years:**
- Save ~$250/month

**Starting later (10 years):**
- Need $150,000: Save ~$875/month
- Need $100,000: Save ~$585/month

**Key Insight**: Starting early makes massive difference due to compound interest.

## Tax Brackets (For Roth vs. Traditional Decision)

### Marginal Tax Rate

The rate on your **last dollar** of income.

**Example (Single Filer, 2025 brackets simplified):**
- $0-$11,000: 10%
- $11,000-$44,725: 12%
- $44,725-$95,375: 22%
- $95,375-$182,100: 24%
- $182,100+: 32%+

**If you earn $60,000:**
- First $11,000 taxed at 10%
- Next $33,725 taxed at 12%
- Last $15,275 taxed at 22%
- **Marginal rate: 22%** (top bracket)
- **Effective rate: ~12%** (average across all)

### Application to Traditional IRA

**If you contribute $7,000 to Traditional IRA:**
- Reduces taxable income by $7,000
- Saves $7,000 × marginal rate
- At 22% bracket: Saves $1,540 in taxes NOW
- Pay taxes later at whatever rate applies then

**If you contribute $7,000 to Roth IRA:**
- No current tax benefit
- Pay $7,000 × 22% = $1,540 now
- Never pay taxes on this money again

**Decision**: Compare current marginal rate to expected retirement rate.

## Quick Reference Table

| What | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Doubling time** | 72 ÷ return | 10% → 7.2 years |
| **Emergency fund** | 3-6 months expenses | $3,000/mo → $9k-$18k |
| **Retirement goal** | 25 × annual expenses | $40k/year → $1M |
| **Retirement savings** | 15% of gross income | $80k income → $12k/year |
| **Stock allocation** | 110 - age | Age 40 → 70% stocks |
| **Net worth target** | Age 30: 1× salary<br>Age 40: 3× salary<br>Age 50: 6× salary | $100k salary at 50 → $600k net worth |

## Key Principle

These are **guidelines**, not absolute rules. Use them as starting points and adjust for your specific situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

The most important calculation is: **Are you consistently saving and investing?**

If yes, you're on the right track regardless of exact percentages.
