# Financial Expertise Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing or editing blog posts about personal finance
- Reviewing financial advice for technical accuracy
- Verifying calculations (compound interest, retirement savings, allocation percentages)
- Checking financial terminology and definitions
- Ensuring recommendations align with Bogleheads and Dave Ramsey principles
- Fact-checking claims about investment performance, fees, or statistics
- Correcting misunderstandings about retirement accounts, taxes, or investment vehicles

## Philosophy Alignment

This skill ensures content aligns with:
- **Bogleheads**: Low-cost index investing, passive management, simplicity, diversification
- **Dave Ramsey**: Debt-free living, behavior change, emergency funds, avoid debt leverage
- **YNAB**: Proactive budgeting, zero-based budgeting, financial intentionality
- **Evidence-Based**: Data-driven decisions, avoiding what statistics prove doesn't work

## Opposes and Corrects

- Stock picking and market timing (data shows 89.5% failure rate)
- Day trading (80-95% failure rate)
- Credit card rewards chasing (behavioral spending increases)
- Debt leverage for investing (risk amplification)
- High-fee actively managed funds (underperform after fees)
- Complex strategies when simple ones work better

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Check Which Topic Area

The financial knowledge base is broken into modular files. Reference the appropriate file:

**Core Philosophy** → `financial-expertise/core-philosophy.md`
- Bogleheads investment principles
- Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps
- YNAB methodology
- Overall financial philosophy

**Retirement Accounts** → `financial-expertise/retirement-accounts.md`
- 401(k), 403(b), IRA, TSP, Roth vs Traditional
- 2025 contribution limits
- Income limits and phase-outs
- When to use which account type

**Investment Vehicles** → `financial-expertise/investment-vehicles.md`
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, index funds
- 3-fund portfolio details
- Target date funds
- Expense ratios and performance data

**What to Avoid** → `financial-expertise/what-to-avoid.md`
- Stock picking failure statistics
- Day trading failure rates
- Credit card behavioral traps
- Debt leverage risks
- Why these approaches fail

**Calculations & Rules** → `financial-expertise/calculations.md`
- Rule of 72
- 4% withdrawal rule
- Asset allocation formulas
- Emergency fund sizing
- Retirement savings targets

### 2. Verify Technical Details

When writing about financial topics:
- Check current contribution limits (2025 data)
- Verify expense ratio comparisons
- Confirm historical return averages
- Validate failure rate statistics
- Ensure terminology is used correctly

### 3. Align Recommendations

Ensure advice follows evidence-based principles:
- ✅ Index funds over active management
- ✅ Simple over complex
- ✅ Low fees over high fees
- ✅ Diversification over concentration
- ✅ Debt elimination before aggressive investing
- ✅ Emergency fund before investing beyond match

### 4. Correct Common Misconceptions

Watch for and correct:
- "I can beat the market with stock picking" → No, 89.5% of pros can't
- "Day trading can be profitable" → No, 97% fail
- "Credit card rewards are free money" → No, behavioral spending increases 12-18%
- "Borrow cheap to invest in stocks" → No, risk amplification is dangerous
- "Active funds are worth the fees" → No, only 10.5% beat index over 15 years
- "You need complex strategies" → No, simple 3-fund portfolio works better

## Reference File Locations

All reference files are in: `.claude/skills/financial-expertise/`

- `core-philosophy.md` - Bogleheads, Ramsey, YNAB principles
- `retirement-accounts.md` - Account types, limits, Roth vs Traditional
- `investment-vehicles.md` - Stocks, bonds, funds, 3-fund portfolio
- `what-to-avoid.md` - Stock picking, day trading, credit cards, leverage
- `calculations.md` - Formulas, rules of thumb, examples

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- General writing that doesn't involve financial accuracy
- When the user explicitly asks for information outside this philosophy (e.g., "explain how day trading works" as educational content, not recommendation)
- Non-financial topics

## Key Principle

**Never provide financial advice or recommendations that contradict evidence-based principles unless explicitly correcting them or explaining them as cautionary examples.**

If content suggests stock picking, day trading, debt leverage, or other high-failure approaches without appropriate warnings, invoke this skill to verify and correct.
