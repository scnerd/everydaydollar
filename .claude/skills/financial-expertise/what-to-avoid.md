# What to Avoid & Why

Evidence-based reasons to avoid common investment mistakes and traps.

---

## Stock Picking

### The Failure Statistics

**Individual Stocks vs. Market:**
- **2/3 of individual stocks underperform** the market index
- **40% of stocks fall 70%** from peak and never recover
- Only **10% of stocks** since 1980 are "mega-winners"
- **Top 2.4% of firms** accounted for ALL net gains in global stock market (1990-2020)

**Individual Investor Performance:**
- Self-directed investors underperform by **4-5% annually**
- Average equity fund investor earned **8.5% less than S&P 500** in 2024 (Dalbar QAIB)
- Human psychology creates consistent mistakes

**Professional Active Management:**
- **89.5% of active funds fail** to beat S&P 500 over 15 years
- **95% of international active funds fail** over same period
- These are professionals with research teams, Bloomberg terminals, full-time focus
- If they can't do it, retail investors have no chance

### Why It Fails

**The Winner Problem:**
- To beat the market, you need to own the winners
- But you can't know which companies will be winners in advance
- Missing just a few top performers tanks your returns
- Index funds guarantee you own ALL the winners

**The Loser Problem:**
- Many stocks go to zero or stay down forever
- Tech bubble: Most dotcoms went bankrupt
- 2008: Financial stocks collapsed, many never recovered
- You can't predict which will fail

**Behavioral Mistakes:**
- **Overconfidence**: Think you're smarter than market
- **Hindsight bias**: "I knew Tesla would succeed" (no you didn't)
- **Confirmation bias**: Only see data supporting your pick
- **Loss aversion**: Hold losers too long, sell winners too early
- **Recency bias**: Buy what recently went up (too late)

**Information Disadvantage:**
- Professionals get information before you
- They have better tools and resources
- They trade in milliseconds, you trade in minutes
- Even they fail - you're at even worse disadvantage

### The Math

**Scenario**: Pick 20 stocks vs. own total market index

**If you pick well:**
- Maybe beat market by 1-2% (very rare)
- More likely underperform by 4-5% (actual data)

**Over 30 years on $100,000:**
- Market at 10%: $1,744,940
- You at 6% (realistic): $574,349
- **Lost $1,170,591** trying to pick winners

### What to Do Instead

Own the entire market through index funds:
- Guaranteed to capture all winners
- Diversified away from all losers
- No stock picking decisions
- No behavioral mistakes
- Just match market returns minus tiny fees

## Day Trading

### The Failure Statistics

**Overwhelming Failure Rate:**
- **80-95% of day traders fail** overall
- **97% failure rate** in comprehensive Brazilian study
- **40% quit within one month**
- **85% fail in first year**
- **87% quit within three years**
- Only **1% remain profitable** after five years

**Financial Performance:**
- **72% of day traders lose money** by year end (FINRA)
- Only **1.1% make money after expenses**
- Active traders underperform by **6.5% annually**
- Compare to buy-and-hold: 1.5% underperformance

### Why It Fails

**The Costs:**
- Trading commissions (adds up with frequency)
- Bid-ask spread (hidden cost on every trade)
- Short-term capital gains tax (ordinary income rates)
- Pattern day trader rule requires $25,000 minimum
- Costs compound rapidly with frequent trading

**The Reality:**
- Short-term price movements are noise, not signal
- Technical analysis doesn't predict future prices
- By the time you see a pattern, it's too late
- High-frequency traders front-run you in milliseconds

**The Psychology:**
- Emotions drive decisions under pressure
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) causes bad entries
- Panic causes bad exits
- Gambler's fallacy: "I'm due for a win"
- Overconfidence after lucky wins

**The Time:**
- Full-time job level commitment required
- Monitor markets 6.5 hours/day
- Research after hours
- Time better spent earning income from actual job

**The Stress:**
- Constant market watching
- Anxiety over positions
- Sleep disruption
- Relationship strain
- Health impacts

### Survivorship Bias

You hear success stories, not the 97% who failed:
- Winners brag, losers stay quiet
- Social media shows profits, hides losses
- Luck looks like skill in short term
- Long-term data shows overwhelming failure

### Day Trading vs. Investing

| Day Trading | Investing |
|-------------|-----------|
| 97% failure rate | Historically positive long-term |
| Full-time job | Set it and forget it |
| High stress | Low stress |
| Heavy taxes | Tax-efficient |
| Costs eat returns | Minimal costs |
| Gambling | Building wealth |

### What to Do Instead

- Buy index funds
- Hold for decades
- Ignore daily fluctuations
- Let compound interest work
- Spend time on your actual career

Day trading is speculation, not investing. It's closer to gambling than wealth building.

## Credit Cards & Rewards Chasing

### Dave Ramsey's Position

"There is no responsible use of credit cards."

### The Behavioral Problem

**Studies Show Increased Spending:**
- People spend **12-18% more** with credit cards vs. cash
- Credit activates no "pain centers" in brain (MIT study)
- Emotional disconnect from money
- Subconscious overspending

**The Rewards Trap:**
- Earn 2% back → Seems like $4,000 on $200,000 spending
- But spend 5-10% more due to card use → $10,000-$20,000 extra
- Net loss: **$6,000-$16,000** to earn $4,000 in "rewards"

### The Debt Statistics

**Current Reality (2025):**
- Average credit card APR: **20-25%**
- Average household with credit card debt: **~$6,000-$7,000**
- Paying minimums takes **20-30 years** to pay off
- Interest paid can **exceed original purchase** price

**The Compound Problem:**
- Miss one payment: Late fee + interest spike
- Carry balance: Interest compounds daily
- "Just this once" becomes pattern
- Small balances become large ones

### The Counter-Argument

Some argue responsible users who:
- Pay off balance in full every month
- Don't spend more to earn points
- Already have strong discipline

...can benefit from rewards.

### Dave Ramsey's Response

**The Risk vs. Reward:**
- Potential reward: 1-2% back
- Risk: Behavioral spending increase 12-18%
- Math doesn't work for most people

**The Philosophy:**
- Debt is a tool to transfer wealth FROM you TO lenders
- Using credit cards keeps you in debt mindset
- Cash creates psychological connection to spending
- Better to spend less overall than chase 2% back

**The Reality:**
- Credit card companies make billions in profit
- They're not giving away free money
- The house always wins on average
- You think you're the exception (most aren't)

### Credit Card Rewards Churning

**The Practice:**
- Open multiple cards for sign-up bonuses
- Meet minimum spending requirements
- Close/downgrade after bonus
- Repeat with new cards

**The Problems:**
- Encourages unnecessary spending to hit minimums
- Hard inquiries lower credit score
- Complex tracking (cognitive load)
- Banks detecting and preventing
- Carrying balances negates all rewards
- Time better spent earning more income

### What to Do Instead

**Dave Ramsey Approach:**
- Use debit card (tied to actual money)
- Use cash for discretionary spending
- Feel the "pain" of spending (helps control it)
- Focus on spending less, not earning back small percentage

**Philosophy:**
- Would you rather spend $190,000 cash
- Or spend $200,000 on credit card to get $4,000 back?
- The first option saves you $6,000 more

## Debt Leverage for Investing

### The Idea

Borrow money at low rate to invest at higher expected return.

**Example:**
- Take $50,000 loan at 4%
- Invest in stocks expecting 10%
- Net 6% on borrowed money
- Sounds good, right?

### Why It Fails for Most People

**Risk Amplification:**
- Losses magnified same as gains
- Market drops 30% → Portfolio worth $35,000
- Still owe $50,000 + interest
- Net: -$15,000 + debt payments

**Forced Selling:**
- Debt payments required even when market down
- May be forced to sell at bottom
- Lock in losses
- Never recover

**Market Timing Impossibility:**
- What if market crashes right after borrowing?
- 10% average doesn't mean 10% every year
- Could be -30%, then +40%, then -10%
- Can you survive the downs while making payments?

**Psychological Stress:**
- Debt + portfolio losses = panic
- Panic causes bad decisions
- Forced to work more to cover payments
- Sleep disruption, anxiety, relationship strain

**No Guarantee of Returns:**
- 10% is long-term average
- Individual years highly variable
- Could have negative returns for 5+ years
- Debt doesn't wait for recovery

### Example of Failure (2008)

**Person A:**
- Borrowed $100,000 in 2007 to invest
- Market crashed -50% in 2008-2009
- Portfolio worth $50,000
- Still owes $100,000
- Can't make payments, forced to sell at bottom
- Lost $50,000 + ruined credit

**Person B:**
- Invested own $100,000 in 2007
- Market crashed -50%
- Portfolio worth $50,000
- No debt, no forced selling
- Held through recovery
- By 2013, back to $100,000+

Same investment, person A destroyed, person B recovered.

### The Only Time It Makes Sense

**Margin at Limited Amounts:**
- Sophisticated investors only
- Small amounts they can cover with emergency fund
- Can withstand total loss without lifestyle impact
- Understand and accept risks

**For 99% of People:**
- Never invest borrowed money
- Never use margin
- Never take loans to invest
- Only invest money you can afford to lose

### What to Do Instead

- Save up cash first
- Invest only what you have
- Let compound interest work without debt risk
- Sleep well at night

**Dave Ramsey**: "The borrower is slave to the lender. Don't be a slave."

## High-Fee Actively Managed Funds

### The Problem

**Performance Reality:**
- 89.5% of active large-cap funds underperform S&P 500 (15 years)
- 95% of active international funds underperform (15 years)
- Can't predict which 10.5% will succeed
- Past performance doesn't predict future results

**Fee Impact:**
- Average active fund: 0.65% expense ratio
- Average index fund: 0.05% expense ratio
- **On $100,000 over 30 years**: $226,796 difference

### Why They Fail

**Costs Matter:**
- Trading costs (commissions, spreads)
- Research costs
- Manager salaries
- Marketing expenses
- All passed to investors through fees

**Can't Predict Market:**
- Nobody consistently times the market
- Stock picking fails 90% of the time
- Behavioral mistakes (managers are human too)
- Luck looks like skill in short term

**Turnover Kills Returns:**
- Active funds trade frequently
- Each trade has costs
- Creates taxable events
- Compounds against performance

### What You're Really Paying For

**When you pay 0.65% for active fund:**
- You're betting your manager is in the 10.5%
- You're paying them to try to beat market
- 90% chance they fail
- You pay the fee either way

**When you pay 0.05% for index fund:**
- You're guaranteed market returns
- No betting required
- No manager risk
- Simple and effective

### The Marketing Trap

Active funds advertise:
- "Our fund beat the market last 3 years!"
- "5-star Morningstar rating!"
- "Expert management team!"

**Reality:**
- Cherry-picked time periods
- Survivorship bias (failed funds closed)
- Ratings don't predict future performance
- Marketing budget comes from your fees

### What to Do Instead

- Choose index funds with lowest expense ratios
- Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab all offer < 0.10% options
- Set it and forget it
- Guaranteed to beat 89.5% of active funds long-term

## Complex Strategies

### The Temptation

- Options trading
- Sector rotation
- Market timing
- Factor tilting
- Hedge funds
- Alternative investments

### The Reality

**More Complexity = More Ways to Fail:**
- More decisions to get wrong
- More costs
- More taxes
- More time required
- More stress

**Simple Beats Complex:**
- 3-fund portfolio beats most complex strategies
- Lower costs compound to better returns
- Fewer decisions = fewer mistakes
- Set it and forget it works

**Who Benefits from Complexity:**
- Financial advisors (higher fees)
- Hedge funds (2% management + 20% performance fees)
- Product providers (selling "innovative" funds)
- NOT you

### The 3-Fund Portfolio Performance

Bogleheads 3-fund portfolio:
- Beats 75%+ of professional investors long-term
- Costs 0.05% vs 1-2% for complex strategies
- Requires annual rebalancing only
- Anyone can implement

Why make it complicated?

### What to Do Instead

- Keep it simple
- 3-fund portfolio or target date fund
- Low costs
- Rebalance annually
- Ignore market noise
- Let compound interest work

**Key Insight**: The investment industry profits from complexity. You profit from simplicity.

## Market Timing

### The Temptation

- "Sell before the crash"
- "Buy the dip"
- "This time is different"
- "I can feel it coming"

### The Reality

**Nobody Can Do It Consistently:**
- Would need to be right twice (when to sell AND when to buy back)
- Being wrong once ruins everything
- Even professionals fail at this
- If they could, they'd be trillionaires

**Missing Best Days Destroys Returns:**
- If you miss the 10 best days in market over 30 years
- Your returns drop from 10% to 5%
- But the best days often follow the worst days
- Can't be out of market trying to time it

**Example (1990-2020):**
- Fully invested: 10.7% annual return
- Missed best 10 days: 6.6% return
- Missed best 20 days: 4.1% return
- Missed best 30 days: 2.1% return

**The Problem:**
- Best days are unpredictable
- Must be invested to capture them
- Sitting in cash means missing them

### What to Do Instead

**Time IN the market > Timing the market**

- Buy and hold for decades
- Ignore daily/monthly/yearly fluctuations
- Rebalance on schedule (not based on predictions)
- Keep adding money regardless of market conditions
- Trust that long-term trend is up

**Historical Reality:**
- Market has always recovered from crashes
- Long-term trend is growth
- Trying to avoid downturns means missing upturns
- Just stay invested

## Summary: The Common Thread

All these approaches share:
- Higher costs
- More complexity
- Lower success rates
- Behavioral traps
- Benefit providers, not investors

The alternative:
- Low-cost index funds
- Simple portfolio (1-3 funds)
- Buy and hold
- Ignore market noise
- Let compound interest work

**The hardest part isn't finding the right strategy. It's ignoring all the bad ones.**
