| Article Title | Clarity | Conciseness | Usefulness | Needs Rewrite | Key Issues |
|--------------|---------|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| Introduction | 8 | 6 | 8 | 4 | Informal phrasing adds unnecessary length ("more than the average Joe"); some rambling. Could tighten opening paragraphs. |
| Planning for Inflation | 7 | 5 | 8 | 6 | Very verbose with excessive parentheticals; repetitive explanations; meanders through examples. Violates "omit needless words" significantly. |
| 401Ks and the other things | 8 | 6 | 9 | 4 | Weak title ("the other things"); some verbose explanations. Good content but could be 20% shorter. |
| The 1-Fund Portfolio | 9 | 7 | 9 | 3 | Strong overall. Minor redundancy in explanations. Clear structure and good use of concrete examples. |
| The 3-Fund Portfolio | 8 | 7 | 9 | 3 | Well-structured with minor verbosity. Strong practical advice. Good balance of explanation and action. |
| Roth vs. Traditional | 8 | 6 | 9 | 4 | Good use of tables and examples, but calculation sections are wordy. The "no free lunch" section could be condensed. |
| Retirement Investing | 8 | 7 | 8 | 3 | Clear conceptual framing. Some philosophical sections could be tighter. Generally solid and well-structured. |
| The Power of Compound Growth | 9 | 6 | 9 | 4 | Excellent concrete examples with numbers. Some repetition across scenarios. Could consolidate similar examples. |
| The myth of debt interest rates | 6 | 4 | 8 | 7 | **Most problematic**: Too long, repetitive scenarios, gets lost in details. Multiple similar examples that could be consolidated. Needs significant condensing. |
| What Are Stocks and Bonds | 8 | 5 | 9 | 5 | Conversational tone is engaging but verbose. Many asides and parentheticals. Excellent foundational content buried in wordiness. |
| What Is Money? | 9 | 4 | 7 | 6 | Story format is very clear but extremely long. Engaging but severely violates "omit needless words." More philosophical than practical. |
| What Is (and isn't) Investing | 8 | 6 | 8 | 4 | Good motivational introduction. Some informal language adds length. Appropriate tone for audience but could be tighter. |

## Specific Elements of Style Violations

**Most Common Violations:**

1. **Rule 13 - Omit needless words** (All articles)
   - Excessive qualifying phrases
   - Redundant explanations
   - Parenthetical asides that disrupt flow

2. **Rule 14 - Avoid succession of loose sentences** (Many articles)
   - Conversational style creates many loose, rambling sentences
   - Frequent use of "and," "but," "so" to string together thoughts

3. **Rule 11 - Put statements in positive form** (Several articles)
   - Frequent use of negative constructions ("I'm not going to...")
   - Could state affirmatively more often

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Cut 20-30% from most articles** by removing:
   - Parenthetical asides
   - Conversational hedging ("I mean," "look," "well")
   - Repetitive examples that make the same point
   - Informal transitions

2. **Restructure verbose articles** (especially "The myth of debt interest rates" and "What Is Money?"):
   - Consolidate similar examples
   - Lead with clear thesis statements
   - Use more topic sentences

3. **Tighten sentence structure**:
   - Convert loose sentences to periodic sentences
   - Use active voice consistently
   - Remove needless qualifiers

4. **Maintain the strengths**:
   - Keep concrete examples and specific numbers
   - Preserve the accessible, non-intimidating tone
   - Maintain practical, useful focus
   - But achieve these goals with fewer words
